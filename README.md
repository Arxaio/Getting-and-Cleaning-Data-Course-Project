# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is written for the peer-graded assignment from coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project". After downloading the dataset from the internet to your working directory, the script "run_analysis.R" is capable of:
* Reading both train and test data sets, merging them and combining subject, activities and features data into one table
* Extracting only the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Labelling activities by replacing "1", "2", etc. with the activities for which they stand for
* Adding descriptive column names
* Creating a second tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
