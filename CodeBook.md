# CodeBook
## Modifications done on original data
* Merging the test and train data 
* Combining subject, activities and features into one table
* Extracting only the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
* Labelling activities 
* Adding descriptive column names
* Creating a second tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

## Column Descriptors
* Subject": Subject ID
* "Activity": Activity performed by subject
